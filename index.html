                            We wanted to create a design language which makes robots more warm and friendly looking. </p>

                         <p>In fact, although the course had a strong focus on engineering, we decided to concentrate instead on the aesthetic, exploring how thoughtful design could help improve the social acceptance of robotic life forms in public environments.</p>

                        <p>Rooted in the philosophy of biocentrism, the project aims to raise awareness among students about the many life forms inhabiting the Design Campus in Calenzano ‚Äî reminding us that humans are not the only residents of this space. To bring this idea to life, we created an Instagram page where we posted zoomed photos of the tiniest life forms we could find around.</p>

                        <p> This way of thinking made me experiment with new languages in graphic design: since we don't know the actual names of these creatures, we assigned each one a unique, ‚Äúillegible sign‚Äù as its symbol, and gave it a lowercase human name ‚Äî because, after all, we have no idea what they call each other. </p>

                         <p>AEKING is my bachelor‚Äôs graduation project ‚Äî a fictional utopian scenario based on IKEA. The thesis explores how sustainable end-of-life flows can be created for IKEA furniture through community-led hacking practices, with the ultimate goal of avoiding landfill waste entirely. .</p>

                         <p>To bring this concept to life, I designed a mock IKEA web platform, along with its visual identity and graphic guidelines. The platform allows users to creatively extend the lifespan of their furniture in multiple ways.</p>

                         <p>On the platform, users can take three types of actions: preserve, repair, or revalue old furniture. Each of these actions forms the basis of a distinct circular economy model, all designed to make these sustainable cycles economically viable and competitive.</p>

                     <p> By analyzing scientific papers and academic articles, we created a final poster that offers an overview of the positive and negative relationships between social media use and mental health.
                        Throughout this project, we deepened our understanding of data culture, learned how to use data to tell compelling stories, and explored new tools such as RawGraphs and Flourish.</p>

                         <p> The "TUBE RUN" is 1 out of the 4 games we developed togheter, which express at his best the CI of this project. The CMF is approached from a limit perspective: we decided to use only cardboard tubes offcuts from print shop to develope the game. Therefore, the finishing choice was fundamental: a bright color and a silky touch feel. The game, also, is contained in a practical net that can be opened by pulling a cord, spreading all the tubes on the ground. The net is up-cycled from apple industry present in South Tyrol, where the project was developed.</p>

                         <p>The project makes possible to reuse pre-consumer waste in polyurethane foam that would otherwise be destined for waste-to-energy or landfill. The project also develops from an innovative method: only after the study of the waste and its characteristics (even on a microscopic level) the developement of the design start. </p>

                         <p>The packaging designed for the project consists in a do-it-yourself kit concept, where the final user can build the surface and "hack"" a seat or backrest.</p>

                     <p>In a 2 workshop we developed a chair based on the blueprints from the book "Autocostruzione" by Enzo Mari. My work reflect on the lifespan of objects and components gerarchy. The backrest is a mattres offcut, folded and stucked between 2 pieces of woood: this guarantee accessibility, facilitating maintenance. </p>

                        <p> Basically I was in need of a portfolio but I did not want to pay monthly for a website builder. That's why I decided to code it my-self! After studying HTML and CSS, I was able to understand web design and develope this project integrating also innovative AI workflows.</p>
